# rms-figma-code-parity

Checks that your CSS code matches your Figma design system. Run it whenever the DS changes — it tells you exactly what's out of sync and where to fix it.

> **Sister tool:** [rms-figma-sync](https://github.com/rafaelmatosds/rms-figma-sync) — checks whether a consumer Figma product file is using the latest DS library. Use that for design handoff; use this one for code implementation.

---

## Quick start

**1 — Install (once per machine)**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelmatosds/rms-figma-code-parity/main/install.sh | bash
```

**2 — Add to a project (once per repo)**

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/rafaelmatosds/rms-figma-code-parity scripts
node scripts/audit.mjs --init
```

`--init` asks 4 questions, auto-detects everything else, and prints a checklist of what to fill in next.

**3 — Run**

Open Claude Code inside the project and run:

```
/rms-figma-code-parity
```

---

## What it does

Every run has two phases:

| Phase | What happens |
|---|---|
| **1 — Figma refresh** | Pulls the latest values from Figma (colors, sizes, fonts, component structure), shows you what changed since last time, and updates the local snapshot files. |
| **2 — Code audit** | Runs 12 automated checks against your CSS and reports everything that doesn't match. |

You always audit against a fresh snapshot. There's no way to accidentally check against yesterday's design.

---

## The 12 checks

| # | What it checks |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Freshness** — Are the snapshot files from today? Are your compiled plugin files newer than their sources? |
| 2 | **Token values** — Do every color, size, and font in your CSS match what Figma says they should be? Checks all color modes (light, dark, etc.). |
| 3 | **Component structure** — Is each component the right height? Are its spacing, font, and corner radius wired to the right tokens — not hardcoded? |
| 4 | **Bound-token coverage** — Is there anything in the Figma frames that has no CSS variable yet? |
| 5 | **CSS hygiene** — Are there CSS variables nobody's using? Are there raw values (colors, sizes) written directly into CSS rules instead of using a token variable? |
| 6 | **Sub-component isolation** — When one DS component is nested inside another, are their styles leaking into each other? |
| 7 | **Visual regression** — Does the live Figma frame still look the same as the last accepted screenshot? |
| 8 | **State coverage** — Does every interactive state from Figma (hover, disabled, selected…) have a CSS rule? Are the right token variables used inside those rules? |
| 9 | **Exemption validity** — Are any "skip this token" exceptions in your config now pointing to tokens that no longer exist? |
| 10 | **Mode completeness** — Do all tokens that are supposed to change between modes (light/dark, compact/comfortable) actually resolve to different values in each mode? |
| 11 | **CSS naming round-trip** — Does every CSS variable name trace back to a real token in the Figma file? Catches variables someone invented that have no design backing. |
| 12 | **Contract coverage** — Are all `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements and SVG icons documented in the structure contract? DS icons must link back to a Figma node ID. |

```

---

## Project setup

### 1. Add as a submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/rafaelmatosds/rms-figma-code-parity scripts
```

This puts the scripts at `scripts/` so `node scripts/audit.mjs` works from your project root.

### 2. Run --init

```bash
node scripts/audit.mjs --init
```

It asks 4 questions, then auto-detects everything else:

1. **Figma file URL** — paste the browser URL of your DS file
2. **Token CSS file** — the file where all your `--variable-name` declarations live; auto-detected if there's only one
3. **Figma access token** *(optional)* — needed for visual regression (check 7) and auto-detecting collection names; saved to `.env`
4. **Upstream DS URL** *(optional)* — if your project uses a branded fork of a shared DS, paste the upstream URL here. Any token where your code matches the upstream (but not the fork) will be marked "pending sync" instead of "fail".

It creates:
- `ds-config.json` — your project's config (commit this, it has no secrets)
- `parity-map.mjs` — where you document any token naming shortcuts
- `structure-contract.mjs` — where you describe each component's expected structure

### 3. Install the Claude Code skill

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cp scripts/rms-figma-code-parity.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

Or just run the one-line installer from the Quick start above — it does this for you.

---

## Using an upstream DS source

If your project is a branded fork of a shared design system, set `figmaSourceKey` in `ds-config.json` to the upstream DS file key. Phase 1 will query both files. Any token where your CSS matches the upstream source (but not the fork snapshot) gets flagged as `⏳ PENDING FIGMA SYNC` instead of ❌ — that means it's not a code bug, just a snapshot that hasn't been updated yet.

---

## Visual regression

Check 7 compares live Figma frame screenshots against stored reference images.

Requires a `FIGMA_TOKEN` in `.env` and at least one frame configured in `ds-config.json`. Silently skips if either is missing.

To accept a visual change as the new baseline:

```bash
mv .parity-refs/<frame-id>.new.png .parity-refs/<frame-id>.png
```

---

## Webhook automation

You can set up automatic parity checks that trigger every time Figma publishes a library update:

```bash
# Start the server (keep it running, e.g. with pm2)
node scripts/webhook-server.mjs

# Register with Figma once (needs a public URL)
FIGMA_TOKEN=xxx node scripts/setup-webhook.mjs --url https://your-host.com/webhook
```

Configure `webhook.port` and `webhook.secret` in `ds-config.json`. The server never modifies your source files — it only reports.

---

## Keeping multiple projects in sync

When you improve the scripts in one project, push the changes and pull them into other projects with:

```bash
git submodule update --remote scripts
```

Your project-specific files (`ds-config.json`, `parity-map.mjs`, `structure-contract.mjs`) stay in your project and are never touched by the submodule update.
